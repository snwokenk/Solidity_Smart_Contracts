# Solidity_Smart_Contracts
Used to hold templates of smart contracts. Included in these templates are fuctions from popular solidity repository

If you would like to host a presale, you can use the WhitelistedCrowdSale.sol. Change the Names of the file and contracts.

If you would like to create an ERC20 token, you can use OToken.sol. 

If you need an additional functionality or for slight customization. Open an Issue.

Thanks,
